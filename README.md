## Video Game Rental Store Project

 The main objective of this project was to create a web application using Java on the backend with Jakarta EE and deploy it on a GlassFish server. Below is a brief summary of the implemented functionalities in this project:

### Implemented Functionalities:

1. **Shopping Cart:**
   - Users can add video games to the shopping cart.
   - They can remove video games from the cart if they change their minds.
   - The cart displays the total quantity of games and the total price.

2. **User Authentication:**
   - Users can log in to the platform using a username and password.
   - They can also log out to protect their privacy.

3. **Rental Management:**
   - Users can view a list of video games available for rental.
   - They can rent a selected video game.
   - The system records the rentals made by each user.

4. **Java Backend with Jakarta EE:**
   - Java was used on the backend to implement the business logic.
   - Jakarta EE (formerly Java EE) was used to develop server components.

5. **Deployment on GlassFish:**
   - The application was deployed on a GlassFish server for execution and availability.

### Project Structure:

The project follows a basic structure of a Java web application, with the following main components:

- **src/main/java:** Contains the Java source files where the backend logic resides.
- **src/main/webapp:** Here are the web files, such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, for the user interface.
- **WEB-INF:** Contains application configuration files, such as web.xml, and other private resources.

### Frontend Technologies:

- **JSP (JavaServer Pages):** Used for dynamic content generation on the server-side.
- **JavaScript:** Implemented for client-side interactivity and validation.
- **HTML:** Markup language for structuring web pages.
- **CSS:** Styling language used for presentation.

### Model-View-Controller (MVC) Architecture:

The frontend follows the MVC pattern for better organization and separation of concerns. 
- **Model:** Represents the data and business logic.
- **View:** Responsible for rendering the user interface.
- **Controller:** Handles user input and updates the model and view accordingly.

### Setup and Execution:

To set up and run the project in a local environment, follow these steps:

1. Ensure GlassFish is installed on your local machine.
2. Clone this repository to your system.
3. Import the project into your preferred IDE (Eclipse, IntelliJ, etc.).
4. Configure the GlassFish server in your IDE and deploy the application.
5. Access the application through your web browser using the URL provided by GlassFish.
